function RPI_priority(value)
// Function to set the priority for the program.
//
// Calling Sequence
//  RPI_priority(value)
//
// Parameters
//  value: The priority to set. Range 0 to 99, both inclusive. 
//
// Description
//  This function attempts to shift the program (or thread in a multi-threaded program) to a higher priority and enables a real-time scheduling. The priority parameter works relative to others â€“ one can make first program priority 1 and second priority 2 and it will have the same effect as setting first to 10 and the second to 90 (as long as no other programs are running with elevated priorities).
//
//  The return value is 0 for success and -1 for error. If an error is returned, the program should then consult the errno global variable, as per the usual conventions.
//
// Examples
//  RPI_priority(50)

//  Jorawar Singh
